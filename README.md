## What the Repository Provides

This repository provides some files used to create various artifacts
(e.g. dynamic libraries) used for handling Clojure and ClojureScript
source code via tree-sitter.

Please see the [what and why document](doc/what-and-why.md) for

## Potential Changes Announcements

Although no major changes are anticipated at this point, there are no
guarantees.  To get a heads-up before such changes occur, please
consider subscribing to the [Potential Changes Announcements
issue](https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure/issues/33) to be
notified beforehand.  Also, please read the section on branches and
tags below.

## Branches and Tags

From 2023-03 we hope to proceed along the following lines.

There are two branches that are viewed as ongoing:

* [The release-related branch](https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure/tree/master)
* [The development-related branch](https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure/tree/dev)

Our intention with the release-related branch is for it to contain:

* what we consider tested code
* tagged commits to use for depending on

Our intention with the development-related branch is for it to be a
focus point for:

* things we are considering for the release-related branch (hopefully
  before too long)
* folks to get an idea of where things might be going either by
  inspection or by trying the code out

Other branches might exist from time to time but it might be better to
view those as transient.
