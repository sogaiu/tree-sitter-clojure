# What the Repository Provides and Why

This document describes what files and directories the repository
provides and associated reasoning.  First it covers the bits that are
likely to be around in the near future.  This is followed by a
description of things that may change or be removed.

One might be interested in this content out of academic curiosity but
more likely it might be because one is thinking of depending on the
repository in some way.

## What and Why

The following is a list of files and directories that are likely to
remain "provided" by the repository unless significant changes occur
elsewhere (e.g. upstream tree-sitter changes what / how they do things
or other grammar repositories decide to change certain practices).
The order is alphabetical and not meant to reflect relative
importance.

* `CHANGELOG.md` - this file contains a changelog.

* `COPYING.txt` - this file contains license information for the
  repository.

* `grammar.js` - this file contains a grammar description and is used
  in the process of generating parser source code that lives in `src`.
  It's likely that this (or something comparable) will continue to be
  provided assuming tree-sitter doesn't change the way it works.

* `package.json` - this file is needed by a
  [component](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/vscode-parse-tree/) of
  [Cursorless](https://www.cursorless.org/).  It uses our grammar via
  yarn and `package.json` seems to be essential [1].

* `queries` - this directory and the simple file it contains are
  provided on request from
  [`difftastic`](https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic) folks.  The
  file it contains doesn't contain much and is not likely to be the
  sort of thing one expects to be used in an editor.

* `README.md` - this file contains the repository's README content.

* `src` - this directory contains source files that are generated [2]
  from `grammar.js`.  The files are typically used to generate a
  dynamic library / shared object that can be used by the tree-sitter
  library to handle Clojure / ClojureScript source code.  Although the
  content of this directory is generated, the files are provided
  because in practice, multiple parties have already become dependant
  on them.  There have been opinions voiced that this should not
  remain so, but change in that direction has not been widespread
  AFAICT.  See
  [here](https://github.com/sogaiu/ts-questions/blob/master/questions/should-parser-source-be-committed/README.md)
  for more on the topic if interested.

* `test` - this directory contains test-related information.  It
  exists partly for tree-sitter's corpus test functionality to work,
  but there is also other content that is used for other testing.

## Other Content

The rest of the content of the repository is subject to change /
removal so depending on such remaining in place is likely not a good
idea.

ATM, some of that includes:

* documentation
* development-related files and directories
* Node.js bindings
* Rust bindings

The bindings are not tested in any way and only really exist as a
side-effect of running the `tree-sitter` cli `generate` subcommand.
They may be removed at some point, but they should be straight-forward
to generate as long as one has a suitable `tree-sitter` cli and the
`grammar.js` file mentioned above.

In order to successfully build the Node.js bindings (say, by an
invocation of `npx node-gyp rebuild`), something like the following
may need to be added to `package.json`:

```json
  "main": "bindings/node",
  "dependencies": {
    "nan": "2.14.2"
  },
```

Note that the version of `nan` may need to be checked.

## Footnotes

[1] The file `package.json` may also be required if it's important to
use some of the capabilities of the `tree-sitter` cli such as the
`tags` and `highlight` subcommands (which we don't typically use).

It's not necessary for all subcommands though (e.g. neither the
`generate` nor `test` subcommands seem to require it).  Its presence
also doesn't signify necessary use of `npm`.

Possibly contrary to what might be indicated elsewhere, `npm` is
not necessary for certain core parts of tree-sitter grammar
development.  However, at the moment, an appropriate version of `node`
_is_ required for the `generate` subcommand to work.

[2] If the grammar uses an external scanner, `src` may contain
non-generated files such as `scanner.c`, `scanner.cc`, etc.  In the
current case, no external scanner is used and the `src` directory
content is entirely generated.
